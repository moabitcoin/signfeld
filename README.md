## :no_bicycles: Synthetic traffic sign detection

This repository collates our efforts on building traffic sign detection model in low (to zero) sample regimes (with little to no human annotations). We leverage templates of known traffic signs to train our detector. We married the ideas of [synthetic text](https://github.com/ankush-me/SynthText) & [object detection](https://github.com/LCAD-UFES/publications-tabelini-ijcnn-2019) for this work to bear fruit. We provide a pre-trained traffic sign detection model trained on [169 German Traffic sign(s)](https://github.com/moabitcoin/Signfeld/blob/master/synthetic_signs/templates/signs.md)

## :computer: Installation

You can either install the code in a virtual environment or docker. Use the docker if you want a reproducible environment.

### :snake: Conda

First, create a virtual environment:
```
conda create -n synth-signs
conda activate synth-signs
conda install pip
```
Then install dependencies and software:
```
pip install .            # If you only want to generate a dataset.
pip install .[inference] # Include Inference
pip install .[trainer]   # Include Model training
```

### :whale: Docker

The following two commands install and run the docker image:
```
make docker-install
make docker-run
```
### :tada: Usage

Download the pre-trained models from [here]() at `resources/models/retinanet`.

#### Detection
```
detect-synthetic-signs --images=synthetic_signs/images/*.jpeg \
                       --label-map=resources/labels/synthetic-signs-169.yaml \
                       --target-label-map=resources/labels/gtsdb-label-to-name.yaml \
                       --config=resources/models/retinanet/config.yaml \
                       --weights=resources/models/retinanet/model_final.pth \
                       --output-dir=/tmp/signfeld
```
#### Visualisation
```
visualize-synthetic-sign-detections --images=synthetic_signs/images/*.jpeg \
                                    --template-dir=synthetic_signs/templates \
                                    --detections=/tmp/signfeld \
                                    --destination=/tmp/signfeld-viz \
                                    --min-confidence=0.5
```
